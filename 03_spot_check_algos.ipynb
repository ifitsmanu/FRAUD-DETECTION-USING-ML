        "\n",
        "Imbalanced data is a pain to work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Why?`\n",
        "\n",
        "Because machine learning techniques typically fail in these scenarios, and if they don't fail...its possible that you may observe misleadingly optimistic performance with your classification model. \n",
        "\n",
        "`Why is that?`\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, many classifications algorithms are designed for situations where you have an equal number of observations for each class. \n",
        "\n",
        "If this is not the case, then algorithms behave in a way where the few minority class examples are not considered \"important\" and are ignored in order to achieve good performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "`When this happens, the result is a model that has poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class.` \n",
        "\n",
        "And in most cases the minority class is one you care about the most! Because the majority class often reflects a normal case, whereas the minority class represents a positive case for a diagnostic, fault, fraud, or other types of exceptional circumstance.\n",
        "\n",
        "A popular solution to the problem of class imbalance is to change the composition of the training dataset. Instead of banging our head against the wall and trying to build a model to deal with the imbalance, we can balance the class frequencies. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of sampling methods available, I'll list just a few of them for you here.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Oversampling\n",
        "\n",
        "Oversampling methods basically create \"fake\" (maybe synthetic is a better word?) examples of the minority class from actual examples of the minority class present in your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the more widely used and implemented oversampling methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Random Oversampling\n",
        " - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)\n",
        " - Borderline-SMOTE\n",
        " - Borderline Oversampling with SVM\n",
        " - Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN)\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most widely used oversampling methods is called `SMOTE` (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). \n",
        "\n",
        "At a high-level, this is what SMOTE does: \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " - Selects a minority class instance at random and finds its k nearest minority class neighbors. \n",
        " \n",
        " - A synthetic instance is created by choosing one of the k nearest neighbors at random\n",
        " \n",
        " - These neighbours are connected to form a line segment in the feature space. \n",
        "\n",
        " - A synthetic instance is created as a convex combination of the two chosen instances a and b.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically: This works by examining examples which are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space, and creating a new sample as a point along that line.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Undersampling\n",
        "\n",
        "Undersampling methods pretty much do the oposite of Oversampling. They delete or select a subset of examples from the majority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some widely used undersampling methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Random Undersampling\n",
        " - Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule (CNN)\n",
        " - Near Miss Undersampling\n",
        " - Tomek Links Undersampling\n",
        " - Edited Nearest Neighbors Rule (ENN)\n",
        " - One-Sided Selection (OSS)\n",
        " - Neighborhood Cleaning Rule (NCR)\n",
        "\n",
        "The most widely used deletion undersampling approach is called `Tomek Links`, which was originally developed as part of an extension to the Condensed Nearest Neighbors rule. \n",
        "\n",
        "A `Tomek Link` refers to a pair of examples in the training dataset that are both nearest neighbors - that is, they have the minimum distance in feature space - and belong to different classes. Tomek Links are often misclassified examples found along the class boundary and the examples in the majority class are deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Combining techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "Used individually, oversampling or undersampling method are pretty effective. But [combining them together](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/combine.html#combine) can often result in better overall model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to sample our data using `SMOTE + Tomek Links`.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Why this combination?`\n",
        "\n",
        "`SMOTE` works by synthesizes new plausible examples from the minority class.  `Tomek Links` identifies pairs of nearest neighbors in a dataset that have different classes. Removing one or both of the examples in these pairs - such as the examples in the majority class -  has the effect creating a less noisy or ambiguous decision boundary.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use the [`imblearn`](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/index.html) library in python to perform this sampling technique, specifically the\n",
        "[`SMOTETomek`](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.combine.SMOTETomek.html) method. We'll then log the resulting data to Comet as an Artifact.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that we'll only apply the sampling methods on the training data.\n",
